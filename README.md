MUSE.IO

Muse.io is a single-page application (SPA) built with React, enabling users to explore museums and their details. The app features user authentication with encrypted passwords, allowing users to create accounts, log in, add reviews to museums, and delete their reviews.

Admins have the capability to manage museum entries by creating, editing, and deleting them. The backend, developed with ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose, provides a REST API with routes for CRUD actions across three database models: users, museums, and reviews. The app includes backend validation, centralized error handling, and is styled using Tailwind CSS.
